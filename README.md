# deeplearningai
Python codes for the exercises of deep learning specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera.
If you are new to deep learning, but have some python knowledge and relatively good understanding of simple linear algebra,
calculus (actually the chain rule), then this course is perfect place to start. 

Another specialization from deeplearning.ai, "Tensorflow in practice", will not be so meaningful,  you will not be able to tell what you do and why you do.

The repository contains all programming assignments, but not in Jupyter,  all the code is written to work separately. 


Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning


Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization


Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects


Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks


Course 5: Sequence Models
